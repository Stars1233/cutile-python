Memory Model
============

cuTile's memory model permits the compiler and hardware to reorder operations
for performance. Without explicit synchronization, the ordering of memory
accesses across |blocks| is not guaranteed.

To coordinate memory accesses between |blocks|, cuTile provides two attributes
for atomic operations:

*   **Memory Order** --- defines the ordering semantics of an atomic operation.
*   **Memory Scope** --- defines the set of |blocks| that participate in ordering.

Synchronization operates at per-element granularity: each element in the array participates
independently in the memory model.

For further details, see the Memory Model section of the `Tile IR documentation <https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/tile-ir/>`_.
